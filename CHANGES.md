##### Morning
After sleeping on it (and getting a coffee this morning) I think I have a better way to handle camera orientation. I'm going to try to keep the avatar (or target object) within some angular radius of the horizontal center of the screen, and between some min and max distance from the player. First the rotation is evaluated, and the camera is rotated on the Y axis so that the target is within the angular restraint, then the camera moves towards or away from the player to meet the distance restraint. This may be what Wind Waker is doing.

##### Morning
Did some late night research into Wind Wakers character/camera controller (by running around in circles for an hour).
Today I'd like to have the avatar turning so that he only moves forward, and the camera following this orientation in some fashion.
Hopefully similar to WW's, because I think that scheme works well for laptops that don't have a separate mouse attached.

##### Next morning
Yesterday I was able to get the character changing orientation smoothly, and blending between idle and walk animations. I got stuck on how to handle camera orientation, and didn't make any progress.

##### Morning
Over the weekend I split the avatar system into a root Avatar module which controls the new AvatarController and AvatarRender submodules. AvatarController manages animation and skeleton updates, while Render is in charge of handling GPU data layouts, uniform updates and rendering. GLTF creates Object3D's for nodes so that Avatar doesn't have to worry about that.

Today I'd like to get a basic implementation of AvatarController working so with mouse + wasd input. The avatar's position and orientation should update according to the look vector, which can be changed with the mouse. Extra's would be a grid shader so that I can see position changes, and beginning to play some movement animations. 

##### Evening
Well, I did most of what I wanted to accomplish. There's a basic LocalAvatarController, WASD changes position based on camera orientation (Only took about an hour). Added a grid shader that I'm relatively happy with, its parameters are driven by the DebugMenu. Didn't investigate animations at all, got distracted by making the OrbitCamera follow an Object3D target. Also made it a bit easier to convert between gl-matrix and ThreeJS vectors, by adding a wrapper around THREE.Vector3. Spent the last hour or two looking at the 100ms+ cost of loading the GLTF. It was shader reflection / error checking, plus an Array conversion in animations. I fixed the latter.

![Daily Screenshot](/screenshots//Screen%20Shot%202020-03-27%20at%207.30.13%20PM.png?raw=true)
* Integrated ThreeJS' animation system. AnimationMixer can now be used to blend and play multiple animations.
* GLTF cubic interpolation for animations is now supported
* ThreeJS' Object3D is now used. This should make it easier to integrate any other three features we may want.

##### To Do
* Make it easier to create objects during resource loading. Their should probably be a POD object for async load, and sync load creates a new full-fat object (for Animation as ThreeJS Clips, Nodes as Object3D, ...)

##### Additions :tada:

* Lots of BMDtoGLTF animation exporting improvements. Animations support cubic splines with tangents. BCKs are now fully supported.
* When a shader fails to compile, it now prints the entire shader source, WITH LINE NUMBERS, before printing the error. Since the errors usually reference line numbers, it's now much easier to fix problems. I should have done this years ago.

##### Fixes :wrench:

* Fixed security vulnerability after notification from GitHub. Minimist needed to be updated to a version >1.2.2. See https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fhm-mqm4-2wp7
* During GLTF loading, skins would accidentally transfer the entire GLB buffer over to the main thread so that their ArrayBufferView could access a tiny portion of it. No longer.

### 2020-25-03

* Composite models with multiple SkinnedModels and Models are better supported.
