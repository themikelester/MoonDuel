### 2020-30-03

Over the weekend I split the avatar system into a root Avatar module which controls the new AvatarController and AvatarRender submodules. AvatarController manages animation and skeleton updates, while Render is in charge of handling GPU data layouts, uniform updates and rendering. GLTF creates Object3D's for nodes so that Avatar doesn't have to worry about that.

Today I'd like to get a basic implementation of AvatarController working so with mouse + wasd input. The avatar's position and orientation should update according to the look vector, which can be changed with the mouse. Extra's would be a grid shader so that I can see position changes, and beginning to play some movement animations.

* Integrated ThreeJS' animation system. AnimationMixer can now be used to blend and play multiple animations.
* GLTF cubic interpolation for animations is now supported
* ThreeJS' Object3D is now used. This should make it easier to integrate any other three features we may want.

##### To Do
* Make it easier to create objects during resource loading. Their should probably be a POD object for async load, and sync load creates a new full-fat object (for Animation as ThreeJS Clips, Nodes as Object3D, ...)

##### Additions :tada:

* Lots of BMDtoGLTF animation exporting improvements. Animations support cubic splines with tangents. BCKs are now fully supported.
* When a shader fails to compile, it now prints the entire shader source, WITH LINE NUMBERS, before printing the error. Since the errors usually reference line numbers, it's now much easier to fix problems. I should have done this years ago.

##### Fixes :wrench:

* Fixed security vulnerability after notification from GitHub. Minimist needed to be updated to a version >1.2.2. See https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fhm-mqm4-2wp7
* During GLTF loading, skins would accidentally transfer the entire GLB buffer over to the main thread so that their ArrayBufferView could access a tiny portion of it. No longer.

### 2020-25-03

* Composite models with multiple SkinnedModels and Models are better supported.
