##### Additions :tada:

* Lots of BMDtoGLTF animation exporting improvements. Animations support cubic splines with tangents. BCKs are now fully supported.
* When a shader fails to compile, it now prints the entire shader source, WITH LINE NUMBERS, before printing the error. Since the errors usually reference line numbers, it's now much easier to fix problems. I should have done this years ago.

##### Fixes :wrench:

* Fixed security vulnerability after notification from GitHub. Minimist needed to be updated to a version >1.2.2. See https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7fhm-mqm4-2wp7
* During GLTF loading, skins would accidentally transfer the entire GLB buffer over to the main thread so that their ArrayBufferView could access a tiny portion of it. No longer.

### 2020-25-03

* Composite models with multiple SkinnedModels and Models are better supported.
